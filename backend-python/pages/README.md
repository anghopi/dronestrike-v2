## Essential Design Patterns
### 1. Form Validation
All pages use Pydantic models for robust form validation:
```python
class MissionForm(BaseModel):
    title: str
    price: float
    
    @validator('price')
    def price_must_be_positive(cls, v):
        if v <= 0:
            raise ValueError('Price must be greater than zero')
        return v
```

### 2. Error Handling
Consistent error handling across all pages:
```python
try:
    # Business logic
    result = self.some_operation()
    return self.create_response(success=True, data=result)
except Exception as e:
    self.add_error('Operation failed')
    return self.create_response(success=False)
```

### 3. Activity Logging
All significant actions are logged for audit trails:
```python
self.log_activity('mission_created', {
    'mission_id': new_mission.id,
    'title': mission_form.title
})
```

### 4. Email Automation
Automated email communications for user engagement:
```python
self.send_email(
    to=client_email,
    subject='Mission Confirmed',
    body=self.generate_confirmation_email(mission),
    html=True
)
```
